# SWITCH-function_with_charts
Wondering how to allow the report user to change the measure that is displayed on the chart?  
With help comes the SWITCH function !
-------------------------

Let's put the year on the X-axis,
on the Y-axis total sales,
in the hatch, let's put the brand category.

To solve our task we need two things : 
1) a table containing a list of names to which we will assign measures. The table will consist of two columns “measure id” and “measure names”.
2) a measure with a SWITCH function

Let's create a new table !
On the HOME tab, in the DATA section, you will find “Enter data”.

Next, let's create a list of measures that we want to switch on the chart.
